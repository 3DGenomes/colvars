Abstract = {A software framework is introduced that facilitates the application of
   biasing algorithms to collective variables of the type commonly employed
   to drive massively parallel molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The
   modular framework that is presented enables one to combine existing
   collective variables into new ones, and combine any chosen collective
   variable with available biasing methods. The latter include the classic
   time-dependent biases referred to as steered MD and targeted MD, the
   temperature-accelerated MD algorithm, as well as the adaptive
   free-energy biases called metadynamics and adaptive biasing force. The
   present modular software is extensible, and portable between commonly
   used MD simulation engines.},
