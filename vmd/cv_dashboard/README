Makefile is used within the VMD plugin distribution, by VMD's own build script.

To install on top of an existing VMD installation, use Makefile.local instead:
Edit the PLUGINDIR variable in that file, and run
make -f Makefile.local install

Even simpler, the Dashboard can be run from any directory, without installing.
Just type in the VMD console:
source <path/to/cv_dashboard.tcl>
cv_dashboard

Note that some spiffy Dashboard features are only available in VMD compiled with
the Colvars Module version 2019-03-21 or later.
