Makefile is used to within the VMD plugin distribution, when building VMD.
To install on top of an existing vmd installation, use Makefile.local:

Edit the PLUGINDIR variable in that file, and run
make -f Makefile.local install

The Dashboard can be run from any directory, without installing. Just type into
the VMD console:

source <path/to/cv_dashboard.tcl>
cv_dashboard
