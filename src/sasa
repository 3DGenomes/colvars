Starting from the version 2016-08-10 of the Colvars module, system
forces have been replaced by total forces.  These now include ALL forces
acting on the variable, whether they come from the force field or from
external terms (e.g. boundary restraints), including those applied by
Colvars.

The values of reported system forces (flag outputSystemForce) may
change, without other changes to the simulation.  When using Adaptive
Biasing Force (ABF), a different trajectory is to be expected when the
ABF method attempts to balance external forces.  However, the change
presents the advantage that the calculated potential of mean force (PMF)
now converges to the same PMF as other methods.

Although the new convention is preferable, it is not possible to
continue an ABF simulation where
